1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,100
The craziest thing is, this is the

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:04,670
closest to understanding who I am.

3
00:00:05,189 --> 00:00:07,939
More than 99.5.

4
00:00:07,939 --> 00:00:08,890
% of the people I know.

5
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:10,839
Number one.

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,350
But okay, number one was the origin.

7
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:22,820
This message that I'm talking about, the

8
00:00:22,849 --> 00:00:24,770
reason it's in random letters is because

9
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:26,640
it was a message that I sent to my friend.

10
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:28,929
And it was back in 2020.

11
00:00:29,315 --> 00:00:30,685
And he was my best friend at the time.

12
00:00:31,245 --> 00:00:32,345
It was one of the toughest

13
00:00:32,345 --> 00:00:33,185
moments of my life.

14
00:00:33,445 --> 00:00:34,655
It was the time my grandfather

15
00:00:34,655 --> 00:00:36,445
died and I didn't know who to tell.

16
00:00:36,605 --> 00:00:38,265
I, I say it in here where I'm like, I,

17
00:00:38,355 --> 00:00:39,834
I feel like I have a hole in my heart.

18
00:00:41,464 --> 00:00:42,434
Because I was thinking about all the

19
00:00:42,435 --> 00:00:44,004
memories that I felt like were deleted.

20
00:00:44,445 --> 00:00:47,035
My grandfather died and it, it felt hopeless.

21
00:00:47,035 --> 00:00:50,094
It felt, why this is on here is

22
00:00:50,094 --> 00:00:53,785
because that moment, that death of my

23
00:00:53,785 --> 00:00:55,345
grandfather changed everything in my life.

24
00:00:56,215 --> 00:00:58,015
Because he was the one person in

25
00:00:58,015 --> 00:01:01,034
my life who respected me way, way,

26
00:01:01,035 --> 00:01:02,674
way more than I respected myself.

27
00:01:03,254 --> 00:01:03,644
And.

28
00:01:04,485 --> 00:01:06,525
In that moment, I felt like, if I

29
00:01:06,535 --> 00:01:08,255
didn't respect myself to the same

30
00:01:08,255 --> 00:01:10,235
extent that he did, even after he

31
00:01:10,235 --> 00:01:13,445
died, then I'm truly letting him die.

32
00:01:15,425 --> 00:01:18,745
Because I, and, once that thought came into

33
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:21,664
my mind, I just, I knew that I had to change.

34
00:01:22,735 --> 00:01:24,155
And I had to change drastically.

35
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:27,554
And, the start of that was respecting myself.

36
00:01:28,874 --> 00:01:30,364
Always origin a stories  start

37
00:01:30,364 --> 00:01:31,584
with someone dying don't they.

38
00:01:32,534 --> 00:01:33,334
But number two,

39
00:01:35,584 --> 00:01:36,655
what should I even name number two?

40
00:01:39,705 --> 00:01:41,955
Insecurities and growth.

41
00:01:43,205 --> 00:01:43,815
This guy.

42
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:46,780
Y'all must know healthy gamer, bro.

43
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:47,820
Um
